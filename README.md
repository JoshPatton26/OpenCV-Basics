# OpenCV Basics
This repository serves as a collection of projects and code snippets that showcase various image and video processing techniques, corner detection algorithms, object detection algorithms, and face detection using cascading classifiers. All examples are implemented using the powerful OpenCV library in Python.



<h2> <b> Projects </b> </h2>
<h3><b>Image Processing and Modification</b></h3>
Explore a variety of image processing techniques, including filtering, transformations, and color manipulation. These examples showcase how to enhance and modify images using OpenCV.

<h3><b> Video Processing and Modification </b></h3>
Learn how to process and manipulate videos using OpenCV. From basic video editing to more advanced tasks like video stabilization, these examples provide insights into working with video streams.

<h3><b> Corner Detection Algorithm </b></h3>
Discover corner detection algorithms that help identify key points in an image. Explore methods like Harris corner detection to detect corners, which are often used in applications like image stitching and tracking.

<h3><b> Object Detection Algorithm </b></h3>
Learn about object detection algorithms that can identify and locate objects within an image. Examples include using techniques like contour detection and template matching to detect specific objects.

<h3><b> Face Detection Algorithm using Cascading Classifiers </b></h3>
Dive into face detection using cascading classifiers, a widely used technique that allows for real-time face detection. Learn how to train classifiers and apply them for tasks like face recognition and emotion detection.

<h3><b> Usage </b></h3>
Each subdirectory in this repository corresponds to a specific project or example. You can navigate into these directories to find the corresponding Python scripts and any associated data files. To run an example, make sure you have Python and OpenCV installed, then execute the script using:

<ol>
    <li> Clone Repository </li>
    <pre> 
        <code>git clone https://github.com/JoshPatton26/OpenCV-Basics.git</code>
    </pre>
    <li> Navigate to Repository </li>
    <pre>
        <code>cd PasswordManager</code>
    </pre>
    <li> Install cv2 Library </li>
    <pre>
        <code>pip install cv2</code>
    </pre>
    Or
    <pre>
        <code>pip3 install cv2</code>
    </pre>
    <li> Run Python File </li>
    <pre>
    <code>python imagestuff.py</code>
    </pre>
    <li> If you have more than one webcam you might need to edit the cv2.VideoCapture(0) argument, and find the Integer value that represents where your camera is accessable. </li>
</ol>
